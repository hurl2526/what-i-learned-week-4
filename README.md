# **What I Learned Week 4**
## **Day 15**
# Using Emmit in HTLM for shortcuts  

.class*5 if i want five with same class

li#item-`$*5{$}`
this will return 5 list with id in number order and string in number order

const item1 = document.querySelector('#item-1’); - This selects item-1 using the ID  

item1.innerText = 'NOT NUMBER ONE';  

item1.style.color = 'red';

const newLi = document.createElement('li’); - This makes a new li  

newLi.innerText= ‘Hello’ - This edits the above li, adding text or style  

const list = document.querySelector('ul’);  - This selects UL or whatever parent you want your new child to be in  

list.appendChild(newLi);  - This is what actually puts the thing you made on the page where you want it

## **Day 16**
presented ugly query

concatenation vs interpolation

Example:  
const greeting = `${firstName} ${middle} ${last name}` instead of first name + “ “ + Middle + “ “ +

Worked on assignment the rest of the day
